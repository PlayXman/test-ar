## Todo
-[ ] Update on rescale.
-[ ] Show/Hide layout button. You should be able to create everything without additional buttons (except add/remove maybe).
-[ ] Camera should be always fixed to the center of the model. You probably don't need to move it around. You would be rotating around center of the model only. Let's see how it's usable on the phones if you have bigger models.
